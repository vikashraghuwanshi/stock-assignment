            #Title: Stock Trade Statistics Display Web Application


The Stock Trade Statistics Display Web Application is designed to fetch and display trade statistics (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) for a particular stock on a specific day using the Polygon free-tier API. The application is divided into two parts: the client (React) and the server (Node.js). The server is responsible for handling API requests, while the client is responsible for user interactions and displaying the data.


Server (app.js) and controller Logic:

    Set up the server using the Express framework and required middleware for handling requests and enabling CORS.
    
    Implemented a POST route at '/api/fetchStockData' to handle incoming requests to fetch stock data.

    In the POST route, extracted the stock symbol and date from the request body.

    Constructed the API URL with the Polygon API base URL and the provided stock symbol and date.

    Used the Axios library to make a GET request to the Polygon API to fetch the stock data.

    Handled possible errors during the API request and responded with appropriate error messages and status codes.

    Extracted the required trade statistics (open, high, low, close, volume) from the API response.

    And Responded to the client with the extracted data in JSON format.


Client (App.js) Logic:

    First, I set up the client-side React application with initial state variables for stockSymbol, date, and stockData.

    Created a form to input the stock symbol and select a date and attached an event handler to handle form submissions.

    On form submission, prevented the default behavior and triggered the handleSubmit function.
    
    Inside the handleSubmit function, called fetch function from fetch_stock_service and it makes a POST request to the server's '/api/fetchStockData' route, passing the stockSymbol and date in the request body.

    Handled potential errors during the API request and updated the stockData state accordingly with the received data.

    Rendered the stockData section when stockData is available, displaying the trade statistics (open, high, low, close, volume) for the selected stock and date.

    Implemented styling to improve the visual appearance of the application, using CSS for layout and design.


Overall Flow:

    The user interacts with the client-side React application by entering the stock symbol and selecting a date.

    Upon form submission, a POST request is sent from the client to the server, passing the stockSymbol and date.

    The server receives the request, constructs the API URL, and makes a GET request to the Polygon API to fetch the stock data.

    The Polygon API returns the trade statistics for the specified stock and date.

    The server processes the response, extracts the required trade statistics, and sends the data back to the client in JSON format.

    The client-side React application receives the data from the server and updates the stockData state.

    The stockData section is conditionally rendered on the UI, displaying the trade statistics for the selected stock and date in a visually appealing card-based layout.




Optional Tasks -


1. Imagine this is a real world scenario which thousands of users use to get the historic data of a stock for a particular day, how would this product change in order to improve the UX.


In a real-world scenario with thousands of users, improving the user experience (UX) becomes crucial to ensure the application can handle high traffic, provide a seamless experience, and meet user expectations.

We can implement load balancing and use scalable server architecture to handle a large number of simultaneous requests without compromising performance.

Optimize server-side code to minimize response time and reduce API call latency.

Monitor application performance and user behavior using analytics tools to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

Use data-driven insights to optimize the application's performance and UX continually.

Introduce user authentication to allow registered users cache their search history, set preferences.




2. What new features would you add in this product to increase it's utility for the end user.

Implement search functionality to allow users to quickly find a specific stock by its    symbol or name.

Add filters to enable users to narrow down their search results based on criteria such as date range, market, or industry.

Utilize interactive charts and graphs to visually represent the stock data for better analysis and understanding.

Allow users to customize the charts by selecting different timeframes or technical indicators.

Implement robust error handling and provide informative error messages to guide users when things go wrong.

Include feedback mechanisms like ratings, reviews, or user surveys to gather user input and improve the application based on user feedback.

Provide support for multiple languages to cater to a global user base.

Create detailed documentation and user guides to help users understand the application's features and functionalities.
